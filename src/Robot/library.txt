https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/Isabelle/dist/library/HOL/HOL/Set.html

Please note: I have kept the names from the HOL Library in the parentheses for easy reference. Please keep these.
The actual names are in " " : these need to be specified or modified.

TIM: To avoid confusion I am going to add phrases that I shall call "pointers". (There may be a better name, in which case I'm happy to change to that, but this is the best I have come up with in a couple of seconds. The idea of a pointer is that it lets the reader know what result is being used. Not all results need pointers, since some are considered too obvious to need comment. For example, with the first one, if we had that a \in \{x. Px\} and deduced that Pa, we would not feel the need to tell the reader that we were using a basic definition of naive set theory. In such cases, rather than putting an empty pointer, I shall simply not put a pointer. I shall enclose pointers in single inverted commas, to distinguish them from names.

I shall also add comments. These are not meant to be part of the library file. They are just questions that arise as I go along.

General comment: I assume that the format of these entries is closely modelled on Isabelle. I think we need to discuss a bit more what format we want to use. For example, you use words like "If", "Then" and "Let". Maybe this is fine and makes the library more human-readable, and maybe some parser can take results in that kind of format and turn them into more of a tableau format. Maybe that's even what we agreed we would do. An alternative would be to write them in tableau format in the first place, with a line that separates hypotheses and conclusions, and no need for those words. It isn't clear to me what is best.

DEFINING SETS

"Subsets defined by comprehension"  (CollectI, CollectD)

Let $X$ be a set
Let $P$ be a property on $X$
Then $\{x: P(x)\}$ is a subset of $X$
Definition: $a \in \{x: P(x)\}$ ⟷ $P(a)$

Comments: I am taking the definition of a property on $X$ to be something along the lines of a function from $X$ to Bool. I have changed the notation from the Haskell-like P x to the mathematician's P(x). And I have put a colon inside the set notation (replacing the full stop that was there before). In general, the principle here is to stick to mathematical notation unless there is a good reason not to. I have (for now) retained the symbol ⟷ because I think there is something to be said for thinking of this syntactically as "is interchangeable with" rather than semantically as "means the same as". I'm not sure how best to convey the information that $\{x: P(x)\}$ is a subset of $X$, so the above formulation is provisional.

Pointer: 'by the definition of set equality'.

Comment: I am adopting a convention where not only does ⟷ mean "is interchangeable with" but that if one direction feels more like an expansion and the other direction more like a de-expansion, then I'll put the two sides in the expanding direction. So most of the time ⟷ will have the more one-way feel of "can be replaced by". I have also replaced \and (which doesn't give the wedge symbol in LaTeX) by \wedge, which is what most mathematicians would write. But this is making a conscious decision to go with LaTeX rather than pseudo-English. 


BASIC SET OPERATIONS: COMPLEMENTS

"Definition of set complement" (***** name needed *****)

Let $X$ be a set
Let $A$ be a subset of $X$
Definition: $A^c = \{x\in X: x\notin A\}$

Comment: This is a slightly dangerous definition since it depends on context. I am assuming that $A$ is quite strongly typed as a subset of $X$, so that ambiguity does not arise, but I'm flagging this up, as it could cause problems, in which case we might have to stick with $X\setminus A$.

BASIC SET OPERATIONS: INTERSECTIONS
 
"Definition of set intersection"  (Int_def)

Let $X$ be a set
Let $A\subset X$
Let $B\subset X$
Definition: $A \cap B = \{x: x \in A \wedge x \in B \}$

Pointer: probably not needed here, but if we had a dial that let the user specify how explicit the write-up should be, then maybe we could have a pointer 'by the definition of set intersection' to be used only in very explicit write-ups. 

Comment: It's actually surprisingly difficult to imagine any situation in which this definition is directly used, so we might even want to comment it out. However, I'll leave it in for the following reason: I have a plan that every library result should be something that the program is capable of proving. The next result is naturally proved by expanding out the definition of $A\cap B$ and using some very simple reasoning, and for that one needs this result. 

Another comment: I briefly toyed with replacing the equality symbol with ⟷ but decided against it because I decided that the equality symbol already has a strong "is interchangeable with" vibe about it, so there was nothing to gain from using ⟷ instead, and some confusion might arise if one did. 

"Definition of set intersection" (Int_Iff and Int_I)

Let $X$ be a set
Let $A$ be a subset of $X$
Let $B$ be a subset of $X$

Then $x \in A \cap B$  ⟷  $x \in A \wedge x \in B$

Pointer: same remark as above.

                                   
%"Definition of set intersection" (IntD1 )

%Let $A$ be a set
%Let $B$ be a set
%Let $c \in A \intersection B$ 
%Then $c \in A$      

%Comment: My instinct is that this should not be in the library. Also, I don't think it *is* the definition of set intersection, so much as a trivial consequence of the definition. The reason I think it shouldn't be in the library is that if we had the statement $c \in A \intersection B$, then we could obtain the hypothesis $c \in A$ by expanding using the previous result. On the other hand, I would not be against including the following result, which says essentially the same.

"An intersection of two sets is contained in each set"  (***** name needed *****)

Let $X$ be a set
Let $A$ be a subset of $X$ 
Let $B$ be a subset of $X$
Then $(A \cap B) \subseteq A$

Comment: The rationale for including this is that it enables the program to engage in high-level reasoning using set-theoretic operations rather than having to expand down and use elements. 

"An intersection of two sets is contained in each set"  (***** name needed *****)

Let $X$ be a set
Let $A$ be a subset of $X$ 
Let $B$ be a subset of $X$

Comment: this is here to save the program having to reason that $A\cap B = B\cap A$ and then use the previous result. But it may be that we will want the program to be good at doing quick bits of reasoning like that, in which case we will not need two results here. (Or another possibility is that at some point we generate simple reformulations of library results automatically rather than typing them all in by hand.)

%Comment: This is another result that I think might not be wanted in the library. Suppose, for example, that we found ourselves wanting to prove that $f ' A \subseteq B$. This result would tell us that we could replace the target by $ \forall x \in A. f x \in B$. But we would get that by first expanding, which would replace the target by $y \in f ` A \implies y \in B$ and then by expanding again to get $(\exists x. x \in A \wedge f(x) = y) \implies y \in B$, which after tidying becomes $\forall x. (x \in A \wedge f x = y) \implies y \in B$ and finally after further tidying (to remove the redundant y) $\forall x. x\in A \implies f x \in B$. All these moves would I think be done with no difficulty by the program, so the library result would not be helping, except that it would be doing all these easy steps in one go. But that I think might be a question more about the write-up -- yes, we don't want a write-up that is full of boring tidying steps, but I think we can find ways of judging which steps fall into that category and omitting them from the write-up. Again, I think this is something we will all need to discuss.

Let $Y$ be a set
Let $f : X \to Y$
Let $A$ be a subset of $X$
Let $B$ be a subset of $Y$  
Then $B \subseteq f ` A \implies B = f ` f^\leftarrow (B)$  
  
Comment: I found that some people use the notation $f^\leftarrow(A)$ for $f^{-1}(A)$. I find that quite readable and it would solve the contextual parsing problem.
